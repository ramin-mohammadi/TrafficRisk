# Traffic Risk RasPi
Repository for implementation of RasPi 4, 64 bit with a light sensor and sense HAT to feed detected temperature (celsius), humidity, and light level (lux) into deep learning model that predicts the safety of a road based on different environmental conditions.
- The road surface condition is determined by temperature and humidity.
- The weather condition is determined by humidity and light.
- The light condition is determined by the light level.
